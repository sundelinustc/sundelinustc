I am a neuroscientist with more than 10 years' experiences of investigating
human brain structures and functions. I am professional at digging out the
inner mechanisms of human behaviors in very big datasets such as tens of
thousands of brain voxels per person in thousands of persons including
clinical patients. I am especially good at delineating the specific profile of
brain responses in clinical patients with mental disorders such as Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I
use diverse analyses methods including machine
learning, network-graph analytics, and statistical models through Matlab, R and Python
softwares.
My work has been published in 29 academic journal articles, 1 book chapter
and 28 conference speaks/posters, which has been cited 818 times (h-index:
16, i10-index: 20). My work has been published in important academic
journals such as EBioMedicine (IF=5.736), The Journal of Neuroscience
(IF=5.673), Translational psychiatry (IF=5.280), Cerebral Cortex (impact
factor [IF]=5.043), Depression And Anxiety (IF=4.702), Human Brain
Mapping (IF=4.421), and Neurobiology of Aging (IF=4.347).
I am also a guest associate editor for both Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
Archive and Frontiers in Cognitive Neuroscience, and a review editor for
Frontiers in Psychiatry, Frontiers in Neuroscience, and Frontiers in
Psychology. Furthermore, I have reviewed for several high impact academic
journals including American Journal of Psychiatry (IF=14.119) and Nature
Communications (IF=12.121). I have edited and reviewed more than 200
journal articles.
