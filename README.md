I am a scientist professional at using machine learning, statistical models, and network-graph analytics through Matlab, R and Python softwares to dig out the inner mechanisms of human behaviors in very big datasets such as tens of thousands of brain voxels per person in thousands of persons including clinical patients. I am especially good at delineating the specific profile of brain responses in patients with mental disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 

My work published in 29 academic journal articles (e.g., EBioMedicine (IF=8.143),  Depression and Anxiety (IF=6.505), Translational psychiatry (IF=6.222), The Journal of Neuroscience (IF=6.167), Cerebral Cortex (IF=5.043), Human Brain Mapping (IF=5.038), and Neurobiology of Aging (IF=4.673)). I also published 2 book chapters and 29 conference speeches/posters. My publications were cited 819 times (h-index: 16, i10-index: 20; [Google Scholar for Delin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5LfHq64AAAAJ&hl=en "Google Scholar")). 

I am also a guest associate editor for 3 journals and a review editor for 5 journals. Moreover, I have edited and reviewed more than 200 articles including those targeting top academic journals such as American Journal of Psychiatry (IF=18.112) and Nature Communications (IF=14.919).
