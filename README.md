I am a scientist professional at using machine learning, statistical models, and network-graph analytics through Matlab, R and Python softwares to dig out the inner mechanisms of human behaviors in very big datasets such as tens of thousands of brain voxels per person in thousands of persons including clinical patients with mental disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, AD; Depression; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD; Smoking; Internet Addiction). 

I have published 29 academic journal articles (e.g., EBioMedicine (IF=8.143),  Depression and Anxiety (IF=6.505), Translational psychiatry (IF=6.222), The Journal of Neuroscience (IF=6.167), Cerebral Cortex (IF=5.043), Human Brain Mapping (IF=5.038), and Neurobiology of Aging (IF=4.673)), 2 book chapters and 29 conference speeches/posters. My work was cited 820 times (h-index: 16, i10-index: 20; [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5LfHq64AAAAJ&hl=en "Google Scholar"); [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Delin-Sun-3 "ResearchGate"); [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delin-sun-b802583a/ "LinkedIn")). 

I am also a guest associate editor for 3 journals and a review editor for 5 journals. Moreover, I have edited and reviewed more than 200 articles including those targeting top academic journals such as American Journal of Psychiatry (IF=18.112) and Nature Communications (IF=14.919).
