I am a scientist with more than 10 years' experiences of investigating human brain structures and functions. I am professional at digging out the inner mechanisms of human behaviors in very big datasets such as tens of thousands of brain voxels per person in thousands of persons including clinical patients. I am especially good at delineating the specific profile of brain responses in clinical patients with mental disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I use diverse analysis methods including machine learning, statistical models, and network-graph analytics through Matlab, R and Python softwares.

My work has been published in 29 academic journal articles, 2 book chapters and 29 conference speeches/posters, which has been cited 819 times (h-index: 16, i10-index: 20). My work has been published in important academic journals such as EBioMedicine (IF=8.143),  Depression and Anxiety (IF=6.505), Translational psychiatry (IF=6.222), The Journal of Neuroscience (IF=6.167), Cerebral Cortex (IF=5.043), Human Brain Mapping (IF=5.038), and Neurobiology of Aging (IF=4.673). 

I serve as a guest associate editor of 3 journals and a review editor of 5 journals. Furthermore, I have edited and reviewed more than 200 articles including those targeting top academic journals such as American Journal of Psychiatry (IF=18.112) and Nature Communications (IF=14.919).
