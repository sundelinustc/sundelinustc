I am a scientist professional at using machine learning, statistical models, and network-graph analytics through Matlab, R, and Python software to dig out the brain structural and functional mechanisms of human behaviors in huge MEGA datasets such as tens of thousands of brain voxels per person in thousands of persons including clinical patients with mental disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, AD; Depression; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD; Smoking; Internet Addiction). 

I have published over 30 academic journal articles, e.g., EBioMedicine (IF=11.1), Depression and Anxiety (IF=7.4), Translational Psychiatry (IF=6.8), Neuroimage (IF=5.7), The Journal of Neuroscience (IF=5.3), Human Brain Mapping (IF=4.8), Neurobiology of Aging (IF=4.2), and Cerebral Cortex (IF=3.7), 2 book chapters and more than 30 conference speeches/posters. My work was cited > 1,300 times (h-index: 20, i10-index: 30; [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5LfHq64AAAAJ&hl=en "Google Scholar"); [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Delin-Sun-3 "ResearchGate"); [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delin-sun-b802583a/ "LinkedIn")). 

I am also a guest associate editor for 3 journals and a review editor for 5 journals. Moreover, I have edited and reviewed more than 200 articles including those targeting top academic journals such as the American Journal of Psychiatry (IF=18.112) and Nature Communications (IF=14.919).
